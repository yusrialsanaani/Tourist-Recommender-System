The Toronto Islands are not only a touristic attraction, but a picnic place with a nice beach and, for me, the greatest pic of the CN Tower!! You can take your friends and family and enjoy the day there, ride a bike or just walk around the Islands...\"], ['We visited by ferry for a few hours and found this to be quite a pleasant park, clean and tidy, with views of the Toronto skyline. Worth a visit in good weather. '], ['A nice day trip especially if you have young children. I would recommend it on a nice summer day. You will not be disappointed.'], ['A must do if you visit Toronto. The ferry was very cheap only $7.50 return, it only takes 10-15 min to sail across. The view is spectacular... if you want the full experience i recommend visiting in the afternoon and watching the sun set, the skyline really comes alive at night.…'], ['Best way to spend a hot sunny day in the city. Good for people of all ages. Several different beaches to check out, all offering different views and activities. '], ['Visiting Toronto Island gives you a completely different perspective of the city.  It is a great place to walk or bike and can easily be toured in 1/2 a day.  There are a few restaurants on the island now that are all casual and fun.  The beaches on the south side of the island…'], ['Wards is an amazing place a jumble of super eclectic houses and dwellings on a number of streets, all on heavily treed streets.  There are a couple of small restos and a beach on the Lake Ontario side which is a great place to swim in the summer...  Outstanding!'], ['Just a 15-20 minute ferry ride to the island...not expensive.  from the hustle and bustle of the fourth largest city in North America, you can take a 20 minute ferry ride to a place of tranquility. the grounds crew do a beautiful job of manicuring the island. there are beaches…'], ['The Toronto island park offers relaxation outside of the busy city. Especially for sports activities or just to free up your mind it worth a visit.  It also offers a stunning view on the Toronto skyline. '], ['A must see. We went on a chilly day in Oct and loved it. Great scenes, lots of wildlife and excellent views of the city from the island and the ferry across. Not much open in the winter months so take supplies with you and also be aware of the ferry times back. We had to wait 45…'], ['I took a Ferry and was there from Downtown in Seven dollars. Really nice natural beauty. Some can walk, sit on benches, see water front, Downtown. Really enjoyable.'], ['The place is amazing. Lost of green area, you can bike, run, picnic etc. It worth every minute we wait for the ferry. Watch out for the dog poop cause they are everywhere.'], ['This is a fun trip, with a 10 minute boat ride across the lake. Fantastic views back towards the city and plenty of opportunities to get great photos of the cityscape. Visiting in October was a little eerie as everything had closed down for winter.
